I am a software developer hailing from North India. I love to work on
meaningful projects with inspiring, creative people.I enjoy learning new things
and am currently teaching myself System Design. I also like meeting new people to talk about
design,
video games, music and ambitious product ideas over coffee or beers. If you do too, lets chat.
